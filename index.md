### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorites because I like the way that the user was able to interact when testing the code. We were able to include choices on what we wanted on our sandwiches. I really like the creativity of the choices we could include. Not only that but it was when we first started writing arguments and learned how to use them. 
* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite of mine because I found it very exciting creating an image for the first time. I really enjoyed this one because we were incorporating the Magick file. Learning that Magick file is what was able to create the color on the images.
* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because I always found the HiLo game to be fun. I found this code very interesting because we included the random number generator. We were able to learn how to use the random number generator and see how it truly does make the game work.
